1. Define a function called `isPalindrome` that takes one parameter, `str`, which is the string to be checked.

2. Inside the function:
   a. Use the `replace` method with a regular expression `/[\s.,\/#!$%\^&\*;:{}=\-_~()]/g` to remove spaces and common punctuation from the input string. This step ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and ignores special characters and spaces.
   b. Convert the modified string to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method to make the comparison case-insensitive.
   c. Split the modified lowercase string into an array of characters using the `split('')` method. This will create an array where each element is a single characte
   r from the string.
   d. Reverse the array using the `reverse()` method. This step effectively reverses the characters in the string.
   e. Join the reversed array of characters back into a string using the `join('')` method. This will give you the reversed version of the original string.
   f. Compare the modified lowercase string with its reversed version using the `===` operator. If they are the same, return `true`, indicating that the input is a palindrome; otherwise, return `false`, indicating that it's not a palindrome.

3. Finally, you can test the `isPalindrome` function by providing different strings as input to see if it correctly identifies palindromes.

Create an object called romanNumerals that maps Roman numeral symbols to their corresponding decimal values. This object contains key-value pairs for the most common Roman numerals.

Initialize an empty string called result to store the Roman numeral representation.

Iterate through each symbol in the romanNumerals object using a for...in loop.

Inside the loop:

Check if the current decimal value associated with the symbol (romanNumerals[symbol]) is less than or equal to the input num.

If it is, append the symbol to the result string and subtract the corresponding decimal value from num.

Repeat this process as long as the decimal value of the symbol can be subtracted from num while keeping num greater than or equal to zero.

After completing the loop, the result string will contain the Roman numeral representation of the original num.

Return the result string as the final Roman numeral representation.
